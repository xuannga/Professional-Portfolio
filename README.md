## Professional-Portfolio

## Description

My motivation and reason to why I built this webpage is to create a portfolio to store all my work inorder for future employers to have easy access to my works.
This project taught me that CSS plays a large role in styling and creating my webpage. I learned how to use the box model to change the look and positioning of the contents. Also learned more about media query screen, flex box and box styling.
